Project Overview
The main goal of this project is to solve a puzzle path problem using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is a popular algorithm used to explore nodes and edges of a graph systematically. In this project, the algorithm is applied to grid-like puzzles to find the shortest path from the start to the target location.

Features
Efficient Path Finding: Uses BFS for finding the shortest path in the puzzle.
Grid Representation: The puzzle is represented as a grid where each cell can either be open or blocked.
Multiple Test Cases: Supports running multiple puzzles and configurations.
Visualization: Includes visual representation of the grid and solution path.
Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
matplotlib (for visualization)
numpy (for grid management)
You can install the necessary packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Chali134/Puzzle-Path-Solving-Using-BFS.git
Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd Puzzle-Path-Solving-Using-BFS
Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To solve a puzzle using the BFS algorithm, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python bfs_solver.py
Command-Line Arguments (if applicable)
You can pass arguments to customize the puzzle input or dimensions:

bash
Copy code
python bfs_solver.py --grid-size 10 --start 0,0 --end 9,9
Example
Hereâ€™s an example of how the grid might look with the BFS solution:

bash
Copy code
S . . . . 
. # # . . 
. . . # . 
. # . . E
Where:

S is the start position
E is the end position
. represents open cells
# represents blocked cells
